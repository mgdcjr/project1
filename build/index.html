      <h4 class="text-3xl mt-10">Early Life</h4>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania. When Bryant was 6 years old his father Joe retired from
        the NBA and moved the family to Italy where he would continue his
        basketball career overseas.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Bryant played both basketball and soccer while in Italy becoming huge
        fans of the Los Angeles Lakers as well as the A.C. Milan soccer team.
        When Bryant was 13 his family moved back to Philadelphia.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Bryant attended Lower Merion High School, starting on the varsity team
        as a freshman. He was named Philadelphia Player of the Year as a junior
        and a fourth team All-American. In Bryant’s senior season he was named
        both Gatorade and Naismith High School Basketball Player of the Year as
        well as being a McDonalds All-American. He led Lower Merion to their
        first state championship in 53 years and was Southeastern Pennsylvania’s
        all-time leading scorer.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Despite scholarship offers from nearly every major college, Bryant
        decided to enter the 1996 NBA Draft.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-3xl mt-10">Lakers Career</h4>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Kobe was drafted 13th overall by the Charlotte Hornets and immediately
        dealt to the Lakers for starting center Vlade Divac. Then-GM Jerry West
        had become enamored with Bryant following a workout in which he
        dominated former NBA players Michael Cooper and Larry Drew in
        scrimmages. This move also freed up salary cap space which the Lakers
        used to sign Shaquille O’Neal.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Kobe spent his first two seasons mostly as a reserve behind Eddie Jones
        and Nick Van Exel. He saw very limited minutes early on, but did become
        the youngest player to play in an NBA game when he made his debut,
        playing 6 scoreless minutes against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Bryant
        would score his first NBA point, a free throw, in the team’s next game
        against the New York Knicks.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        As the season went on, Bryant gradually began to earn more minutes and
        became the youngest player to start an NBA game in a January 28 victory
        over the Dallas Mavericks. During All-Star Weekend Bryant would win the
        1997 Slam Dunk Championship and his performance through the season
        earned an NBA All-Rookie Second Team selection.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        The Lakers would make the second round of the playoffs that season,
        falling to the Utah Jazz 4-1. In the deciding fifth game, Bryant found
        himself on the floor down the stretch and in overtime, but airballed
        multiple shots as the Jazz would clinch the elimination.
      </p>
      Bryant remained a reserve for his second season, but his minutes increased
      and as a result, his scoring more than doubled. He would earn his first
      All-Star selection, along with teammates O’Neal, Jones, and Van Exel, and
      finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting to behind Toni Kukoc of
      the Chicago Bulls.
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        After the Lakers traded away Jones and Van Exel, Bryant became a
        full-time starter in his third season. He also signed a six-year, $70
        extension with the Lakers during the season, and was named to the
        All-NBA Third Team.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Phil Jackson became the Lakers head coach ahead of the 1999-2000 season
        and his presence immediately paid dividends as he structured the famed
        triangle offense around Kobe and Shaq. The Lakers would win 67 games as
        O’Neal would win NBA MVP. Kobe grew immensely as well, being named to
        his first All-Defense First Team while also making All-NBA Second Team.
        He was also named to his second All-Star team, beginning a streak of 17
        straight selections. On March 12, 2000, Kobe notched his first career
        40-point game in a 109-106 win over the Sacramento Kings.
      </p>
      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Kobe’s growth was even more evident in the playoffs. In Game 7 of the
        Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, Kobe led
        the Lakers with 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 block, as the
        Lakers came back from a 15-point fourth quarter deficit to advance to
        the NBA Finals. He punctuated the victory with the famous alley-oop to
        Shaquille O’Neal.
      </p>

      <p class="text-1xl text-justify w-full mx-auto my-5">
        Bryant also came up huge in those Finals, particularly in Game 4 where
        he scored 22 points in the second half and led the Lakers to a huge
        120-118 road win in overtime after Shaquille O’Neal fouled out. The
        Lakers would go on to win the series in 6 games, winning their first NBA
        Championship since 1988.
